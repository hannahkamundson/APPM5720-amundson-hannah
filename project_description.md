The project will take a simulation and optimize a given objectivv. I will need to create a script for the simulation; I am particularly interested in a financial simulation. (While I am interested in optimization, I am also open to another type of project if you have any suggestions.)

I think this project could utilize an HPC by running multiple simulations at the same time. 

I can probably spend about 4 hours per week on this project.
